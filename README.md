Background
----------
LiquidFun adds particle systems to Box2D.
LiquidFun comes with barebone Java bindings (generated by Swig), which only support a small set of functionalities.
This project provides more support, adding the basic types of joints and the ability to listen to collisions.

Notice that a complete Java rewrite of LiquidFun exists, called JBox2D.

This project is developed for educational purposes at the University of Naples "Federico II", Italy.
