JLiquidFun
==========

Ready-to-use Java bindings for LiquidFun, including the pre-compiled library for Android architectures.

Instructions to use JLiquidFun in your Android Studio project:
------------

- Copy the content of `java` into your folder `<project root>/app/src/main/java`
- Copy the content of `libs` into your folder `<project root>/app/src/main/jniLibs`

In your onCreate method, load the library:

    System.loadLibrary(“liquidfun”);
    System.loadLibrary(“liquidfun_jni”);

Then, you can create a World, add Body objects to it, etc.

Background
----------
LiquidFun adds particle systems to Box2D.
LiquidFun comes with barebone Java bindings (generated by Swig), which only support a small set of functionalities.
This project provides more support, adding the basic types of joints and the ability to listen to collisions.

It was developed for educational purposes at the University of Naples "Federico II", Italy.
